As fall quickly approaches it is time to check in on what I am currently working on and learning about.

## This Website

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build): a relatively new static site generator. I spent some time experimenting with Astro before building this site, but never built a complete site with it. So far my experience has been mostly positive but I have run into a few issues along the way. [Version 1.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-1/) was released only <span title="August 8, 2022">a month ago</span>, and the project is already up to version 1.2.1, so I can accept these issues as an early adopter.

## GitHub

Even though I have used GitHub <span title="I created my account in 2016, but only started using it consistently in 2019.">for years</span> there are still many features that I have not worked with before. I recently learned how to:

- Host this website on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name
- Configure a GitHub Action to deploy changes when commits are pushed
- [Automatically link commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#commit-shas) in issue comments
- Set branch protection rules to prevent commits directly to main branch
