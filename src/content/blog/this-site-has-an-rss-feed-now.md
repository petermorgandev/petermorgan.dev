You can now [subscribe to my blog](/rss.xml) via RSS. Astro's @astrojs/rss integration and [documentation "recipe"](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/) made the process of creating the feed's XML file quick and easy to complete. [This commit on GitHub](https://github.com/petermorgandev/petermorgan.dev/commit/053b66f553233a0de3533556e996d9e96eccb361) includes all of the code changes required to create the XML file and [enable auto-discovery](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/#enabling-rss-feed-auto-discovery).
